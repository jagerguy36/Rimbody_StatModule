    <description># Rimbody_StatModule
Stat Module for Rimbody, a RimWorld Mod. This module integrates Rimbodyâ€™s Muscle Mass and Body Fat into pawns' stats.

## Features
 * Muscle is mostly beneficial to the stats, as most work needs muscle, and you don't gain muscle easily.
 * Fat is not so beneficial, but high fat will come in handy when you are starving, and having low fat can be deadly when you have no food.
 * Rimbody is also designed so that Fat helps pawns keep their muscle (bodyfat lowers muscle loss), so having a moderate, healthy amount of fat can be beneficial.</description>
